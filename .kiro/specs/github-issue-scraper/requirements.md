# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a tool for scraping GitHub issues within specific repositories and product areas to identify relevant problems and extract key information. The tool will authenticate with GitHub, navigate to repository issues, filter by relevance to a specified product area, and generate comprehensive summaries including workarounds and key details from issue descriptions and comments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to scrape GitHub issues for a specific repository and product area, so that I can quickly understand the current problems and pain points users are experiencing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a GitHub repository URL and product area THEN the system SHALL authenticate with GitHub using proper access tokens
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL navigate to the repository's issues section
3. WHEN accessing the issues THEN the system SHALL filter for open issues relevant to the specified product area
4. WHEN relevant issues are identified THEN the system SHALL extract key details from issue descriptions and comments
5. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a markdown file named after the repository and product area

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to extract comprehensive information from each relevant issue, so that I can understand the full context and any available solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing each relevant issue THEN the system SHALL extract the issue title, description, labels, and creation date
2. WHEN processing issue comments THEN the system SHALL identify and extract workarounds provided by users or developers
3. WHEN processing issue content THEN the system SHALL generate an executive summary for each issue
4. WHEN multiple workarounds exist THEN the system SHALL list all available workarounds with their sources
5. WHEN issue processing is complete THEN the system SHALL include issue priority indicators based on labels and activity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the tool to properly authenticate and handle GitHub API limits, so that I can reliably scrape issues without encountering access errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is first configured THEN the system SHALL prompt for and securely store GitHub authentication tokens
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL respect GitHub rate limits and implement appropriate backoff strategies
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance for token setup
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL wait and retry requests automatically
5. WHEN access is denied to private repositories THEN the system SHALL inform the user of permission requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the output to be well-structured and easily readable, so that I can quickly scan through the findings and identify the most important issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the output file THEN the system SHALL create a markdown file with clear section headers
2. WHEN organizing issues THEN the system SHALL sort them by relevance score or activity level
3. WHEN presenting each issue THEN the system SHALL include a consistent format with title, summary, labels, and workarounds
4. WHEN workarounds are available THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between official developer responses and community solutions
5. WHEN the file is generated THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as scrape date, repository info, and total issues found

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify the product area or topic of interest, so that the tool only returns issues relevant to my research needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying a product area THEN the system SHALL accept keywords, labels, or topic descriptions as input
2. WHEN filtering issues THEN the system SHALL search issue titles, descriptions, and labels for relevance matches
3. WHEN relevance is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use fuzzy matching and keyword similarity scoring
4. WHEN no relevant issues are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest broadening the search criteria
5. WHEN too many issues match THEN the system SHALL limit results to the most relevant or recent issues with a configurable maximum
