### Setting up JAN for LLM Analysis

This tool uses JAN's local LLM capabilities for intelligent issue analysis. Follow these steps to set up JAN:

1. **Install JAN**:

   - Download JAN from the official website: https://jan.ai/
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
   - JAN provides a user-friendly interface for managing local LLMs
   - System requirements:
     - **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, dual-core CPU, 10GB free disk space
     - **Recommended**: 16GB RAM, quad-core CPU, 20GB free disk space
     - **For best performance**: 32GB RAM, 8+ core CPU or GPU acceleration

2. **Start JAN**:

   - Launch the JAN application
   - JAN runs a local server that provides an OpenAI-compatible API
   - The default endpoint is http://localhost:1337
   - Verify the server is running by visiting http://localhost:1337/health in your browser

3. **Load a Model**:

   - In the JAN interface, go to the Models tab
   - Download and load a model based on your needs:
     - **llama2** (Default): Good balance of performance and resource usage
     - **mistral**: Excellent analysis capabilities, better workaround extraction
     - **phi**: Lightweight option for systems with limited resources
     - **llama3**: Comprehensive understanding, best for in-depth analysis
   - Click on the model name to download it
   - After downloading, click "Load" to activate the model

4. **Test JAN Connectivity**:

   ```bash
   github-issue-scraper --test-jan
   ```

   This command will:

   - Verify that JAN is running and accessible
   - List all available models in your JAN installation
   - Test if your selected model is properly loaded
   - Save successful configuration for future use

5. **Configure JAN Options**:

   ```bash
   # Set custom JAN endpoint (if not using default)
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --jan-endpoint http://localhost:1337

   # Specify which model to use
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --jan-model mistral

   # Set both endpoint and model
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --jan-endpoint http://localhost:1337 --jan-model phi
   ```

   You can also set these options using environment variables:

   ```bash
   export JAN_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:1337
   export JAN_MODEL=mistral
   ```

6. **Model Selection Guide**:

   | Model   | Best For                                       | Resource Usage |
   | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
   | llama2  | General analysis, balanced performance         | Medium         |
   | mistral | Technical repositories, detailed analysis      | Medium-High    |
   | phi     | Quick analysis, systems with limited resources | Low            |
   | llama3  | In-depth analysis, complex technical issues    | High           |

7. **Troubleshooting JAN Connection**:
   - Ensure JAN is running before starting the scraper
   - Check that your selected model is properly loaded in JAN
   - For large repositories, use smaller batch sizes or more powerful models
   - If analysis fails, try a different model or reduce the number of issues
   - Run with `--verbose` flag to see detailed JAN interaction logs
   - See the detailed JAN integration guide: [docs/jan-guide.md](docs/jan-guide.md)

## How It Works

The GitHub Issue Scraper uses a **LLM-powered analysis approach**:

### Phase 1: GitHub API Integration

- Retrieves issues from the specified GitHub repository
- Handles authentication and rate limiting automatically
- Collects all issue metadata, comments, and related information
- Prepares structured data for LLM analysis

### Phase 2: JAN LLM Analysis

- Sends issue data to JAN's local LLM for intelligent analysis
- Uses carefully crafted prompts to guide the LLM's analysis process
- Processes issues in batches to optimize performance and manage context limits
- Implements fallback strategies for handling large repositories

### Phase 3: LLM-Powered Intelligence

- **Relevance Scoring**: LLM determines how relevant each issue is to your product area (0-100%)
- **Workaround Extraction**: LLM identifies solutions from issue comments with author attribution
- **Issue Summarization**: LLM generates concise summaries of complex issues
- **Categorization**: LLM groups issues into meaningful categories
- **Priority Assessment**: LLM determines issue priority based on content analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: LLM evaluates the sentiment expressed in issues and comments

### Benefits

- üß† **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses natural language understanding instead of keyword matching
- üîç **Context-Aware**: Understands semantic meaning and relevance beyond simple text matching
- üí° **Solution Finding**: Automatically extracts workarounds that might be buried in comments
- üìä **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates rich, structured reports with meaningful insights
- üöÄ **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your machine through JAN, keeping data private

## LLM Analysis Details

### Understanding LLM-Generated Relevance Scores

The relevance score (0-100) indicates how closely an issue matches your product area:

- **90-100**: Directly addresses core aspects of the product area
- **70-89**: Strongly related to the product area with significant impact
- **50-69**: Moderately related with some relevant aspects
- **30-49**: Tangentially related or with minor relevance
- **0-29**: Minimal or no relevance to the product area

### Interpreting Workaround Classifications

The LLM classifies workarounds based on:

- **Author Type**:

  - **Maintainer**: Solutions from project maintainers or core team members
  - **Contributor**: Solutions from regular contributors or experienced users
  - **User**: Solutions from general community members

- **Effectiveness Rating**:

  - **Confirmed**: Workaround has been verified to solve the issue
  - **Suggested**: Proposed solution that may work but lacks confirmation
  - **Partial**: Solution that addresses part of the issue or works in limited cases

- **Confidence Score**: Indicates the LLM's confidence (0-100%) in the workaround's validity

### LLM-Generated Categories

The LLM automatically categorizes issues into meaningful groups based on:

- Root cause analysis
- Affected components
- Issue patterns and similarities
- Technical domains

```

### Understanding LLM Analysis Results

The GitHub Issue Scraper leverages JAN's LLM capabilities to provide rich, intelligent analysis:

#### 1. Relevance Scoring

Each issue receives a relevance score (0-100) indicating how closely it matches your product area:

| Score Range | Interpretation                                 | Action                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 90-100      | Direct match to core product area concerns     | Highest priority for review           |
| 70-89       | Strong relevance with significant impact       | Important to address                  |
| 50-69       | Moderate relevance with some important aspects | Consider after higher priority issues |
| 30-49       | Tangential relevance or minor connection       | Review if time permits                |
| 0-29        | Minimal relevance (filtered out by default)    | Typically safe to ignore              |

#### 2. Workaround Classification

The LLM identifies solutions from issue comments and classifies them:

**Author Types:**

- **Maintainer**: Official solutions from project team members (highest reliability)
- **Contributor**: Solutions from regular contributors (good reliability)
- **User**: Community-suggested solutions (variable reliability)

**Effectiveness Ratings:**

- **Confirmed**: Solution verified to work (highest confidence)
- **Suggested**: Proposed solution without verification (medium confidence)
- **Partial**: Solution that works in some cases (limited confidence)

**Confidence Score:**

- A percentage (0-100%) indicating the LLM's confidence in the solution
- Higher scores (80%+) indicate more reliable workarounds

#### 3. Sample Analysis Interpretation

For the example above:

- The issue has **very high relevance** (92/100) to the product area
- It's categorized as a **"Performance Degradation"** issue with **high priority**
- There are **two workarounds**:
  1. An **official solution** from the VS Code team (95% confidence)
  2. A **community suggestion** with good but lower confidence (80%)
- The issue has a **negative sentiment**, indicating user frustration
- It's tagged with relevant keywords for easy categorization

#### 4. Factors Affecting Analysis Quality

- **Model selection**: Different JAN models have different analysis capabilities
- **Issue complexity**: More complex issues may have less accurate analysis
- **Comment quality**: Clear, detailed comments yield better workaround extraction
- **Product area specificity**: More specific product areas yield more focused results

## Troubleshooting

### JAN Integration Issues

#### Problem: `JAN server connection failed`

```bash
Error: Cannot connect to JAN server at http://localhost:1337. Is JAN running?
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Check if JAN is running**:

   - Open the JAN application
   - Verify it's running and the interface is accessible
   - Check the status indicator in the JAN UI

2. **Verify endpoint configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Test JAN connectivity
   github-issue-scraper --test-jan

   # Specify custom endpoint if needed
   github-issue-scraper --test-jan --jan-endpoint http://localhost:1337
   ```

3. **Restart JAN**:
   - Close and reopen the JAN application
   - Wait for it to fully initialize before retrying

#### Problem: `Model not found in JAN`

```bash
Error: Model 'llama2' is not loaded in JAN. Available models: mistral, phi
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Load the model in JAN**:

   - Open JAN application
   - Go to the Models tab
   - Download and load the required model

2. **Use an available model**:

   ```bash
   # List available models
   github-issue-scraper --test-jan

   # Use an available model
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --jan-model mistral
   ```

3. **Check model name spelling**:
   - Model names are case-sensitive
   - Use the exact name as shown in JAN's interface

#### Problem: `LLM context length exceeded`

```bash
Error: LLM context length exceeded during analysis.
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce batch size**:

   ```bash
   # Process fewer issues at once
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --max-issues 25
   ```

2. **Use a model with larger context window**:

   ```bash
   # Switch to a model with larger context capacity
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --jan-model mistral-large
   ```

3. **Simplify analysis**:
   - Focus on more specific product areas
   - Filter issues by labels or state first

#### Problem: `Invalid LLM response format`

```bash
Error: Failed to parse LLM response as valid JSON.
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Try a different model**:

   ```bash
   # Some models produce more consistent outputs
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --jan-model llama2
   ```

2. **Check JAN version**:

   - Ensure you're using a recent version of JAN
   - Update JAN if necessary

3. **Reduce complexity**:
   ```bash
   # Process fewer issues at once
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --max-issues 10
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Authentication Problems

**Problem**: `Authentication failed: Bad credentials`

```bash
Error: Authentication failed: Bad credentials
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Check token validity**:

   ```bash
   # Test your token manually
   curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
   ```

2. **Regenerate token**:

   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Delete the old token and create a new one
   - Ensure proper scopes are selected (`repo` or `public_repo`)

3. **Clear and reconfigure**:

   ```bash
   # Remove old configuration
   rm -rf ~/.github-issue-scraper/

   # Run setup again
   github-issue-scraper --setup
   ```

#### Repository Access Issues

**Problem**: `Repository access failed: Not Found`

```bash
Error: Repository access failed: Not Found
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify repository format**:

   ```bash
   # Correct format: owner/repository
   github-issue-scraper -r microsoft/vscode -p "performance"

   # Incorrect formats:
   # ‚ùå https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
   # ‚ùå microsoft/vscode/issues
   # ‚ùå vscode
   ```

2. **Check repository existence**:

   - Visit `https://github.com/owner/repository` in your browser
   - Ensure the repository is public or you have access

3. **Private repository access**:
   - Ensure your token has `repo` scope (not just `public_repo`)
   - Verify you're a collaborator on private repositories

#### Rate Limiting

**Problem**: `API rate limit exceeded`

```bash
Error: API rate limit exceeded. Try again later.
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Wait and retry**:

   - GitHub allows 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated users
   - Wait for the rate limit to reset (shown in error message)

2. **Use authenticated requests**:

   ```bash
   # Ensure token is properly set
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords"
   ```

3. **Reduce request frequency**:
   ```bash
   # Process fewer issues
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --max-issues 25
   ```

#### No Results Found

**Problem**: `No relevant issues found`

```bash
Warning: No relevant issues found for product area "very specific keywords"
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Broaden search terms**:

   ```bash
   # Instead of very specific terms
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "authentication OAuth2 JWT token validation"

   # Try broader terms
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "authentication"
   ```

2. **Lower relevance threshold**:

   ```bash
   # Default threshold is 30, try lower
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --min-relevance-score 15
   ```

3. **Check issue availability**:

   ```bash
   # Use verbose mode to see what's happening
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --verbose
   ```

4. **Verify repository has issues**:
   - Visit the repository's Issues tab on GitHub
   - Some repositories disable issues or have very few

#### Network and Connection Issues

**Problem**: Network timeouts or connection errors

```bash
Error: Network error: connect ECONNREFUSED
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Check internet connection**:

   ```bash
   # Test GitHub API connectivity
   curl https://api.github.com/
   ```

2. **Corporate firewall/proxy**:

   ```bash
   # Set proxy if needed
   export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   ```

3. **VPN issues**:
   - Try disconnecting from VPN
   - Some VPNs block GitHub API access

#### Configuration Issues

**Problem**: `Configuration validation failed`

```bash
Error: Configuration validation failed: Repository is required
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Use interactive mode**:

   ```bash
   github-issue-scraper --interactive
   ```

2. **Set required parameters**:

   ```bash
   # Ensure both repository and product area are provided
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords"
   ```

3. **Check environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Verify environment variables are set correctly
   echo $GITHUB_TOKEN
   echo $GITHUB_REPOSITORY
   ```

#### File Permission Issues

**Problem**: Cannot write to output directory

```bash
Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir './reports'
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Check directory permissions**:

   ```bash
   # Create directory manually
   mkdir -p ./reports
   chmod 755 ./reports
   ```

2. **Use different output path**:

   ```bash
   # Use home directory
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --output-path ~/reports

   # Use temporary directory
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --output-path /tmp/reports
   ```

#### Installation Issues

**Problem**: Command not found after installation

```bash
bash: github-issue-scraper: command not found
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Use npm link**:

   ```bash
   # In the project directory
   npm link
   ```

2. **Use npx**:

   ```bash
   npx github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords"
   ```

3. **Run directly**:
   ```bash
   # From project directory
   node dist/cli/index.js -r owner/repo -p "keywords"
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging to get detailed information:

```bash
github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --verbose
```

This will show:

- Authentication details
- API request/response information
- Relevance scoring details
- File operations
- Error stack traces

### Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the logs**: Use `--verbose` flag for detailed output
2. **Verify your setup**: Run `github-issue-scraper --setup` to reconfigure
3. **Test with a known repository**: Try with `microsoft/vscode` or `facebook/react`
4. **Check GitHub status**: Visit [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)
5. **Report bugs**: Create an issue with:
   - Command you ran
   - Full error message
   - Operating system and Node.js version
   - Output with `--verbose` flag

### Performance Tips

1. **Optimize issue limits**:

   ```bash
   # For quick testing
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --max-issues 10

   # For comprehensive analysis
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --max-issues 100
   ```

2. **Use specific keywords**:

   ```bash
   # More specific = faster processing
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "authentication bug"

   # Less specific = more processing time
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "issue"
   ```

3. **Adjust relevance scoring**:
   ```bash
   # Higher threshold = fewer results, faster processing
   github-issue-scraper -r owner/repo -p "keywords" --min-relevance-score 50
   ```
